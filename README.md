# Silent Hill - Native iOS Port

  **A native iOS port built on the Silent Hill PSX decompilation.** It shares the whole engine with the [PC port](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/tree/pc-port) and the [Android port](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/tree/android-port): the same decompiled C source, compiled for arm64 and running on [PsyCross](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/PsyCross) (our fork of the PsyQ compatibility layer) through SDL2 and OpenGL ES 3.0. It is **not an emulator** and **not a static recompilation**. Game logic and feel match the PSX original, and every enhancement is optional.

  **Development is heavily AI-assisted** (Claude Opus 4.6, 4.7 and the newer Fable model), and we're open about that. Every change is a reviewed, hand-directed edit to real source, tested against the original behaviour.

## Licensing at a glance

**The port is GPL-3.0.** That covers `pc_port/`, `ios_port/` and every `SH_PC_PORT` addition to the decompiled sources.

**The decompilation is not licensed by this project.** `src/`, `include/`, `configs/`, `asm/`, `lib/` and `rom/` remain the work of the [silent-hill-decomp](https://github.com/shdecompilations/silent-hill-decomp) contributors.

**No game data is included.** Silent Hill is © Konami. You need your own legally obtained disc image; nothing from it ships in the app.

## Features

- **The full game.** Every map, boss, cutscene and ending. All 43 map overlays are linked into the app.
- **Touch controls.** A floating movement stick, drag-to-look, tap to act, and on-screen Aim / Item / Map / Start buttons, with a separate Fire button while aiming (**One Button Combat** merges them). Menus work by tapping. The third-person, over-the-shoulder and first-person cameras also work on touch, and an on-screen eye button cycles between them. The buttons send whatever your controller config has bound, so rebinds carry over.
- **Controllers.** Paired Bluetooth pads work, and the touch overlay steps aside when one is in use. Remap them under **Options > Controller Config**.
- **Graphics.** Renders at the device's native resolution in widescreen (Hor+) by default, at 60 fps. PGXP perspective correction and the rest of the PC port's graphics options are available too.
- **Quick options overlay.** Graphics, HUD, audio and cheats, opened from an on-screen button.
- **RetroAchievements.** Sign in from **Options > System > Achievements** with a native sign-in sheet (softcore only). Your password is exchanged once for a token and is never stored.
- **Mods.** Loose-file replacements and DuckStation-style texture packs. See [Modding](#modding).
- **All regions.** USA, PAL and NTSC-J discs are auto-detected.

## Known Issues / Bugs

- **No FMV overrides.** The iOS build has no libjpeg or ffmpeg, so HD AVI/MP4 movie replacements are ignored. The disc's own cutscenes still play.
- **No surround audio.** Audio is stereo, rendered in software through SDL, because Apple removed OpenAL.
- **No Randomizer.** Its Lua scripting layer needs `system()`, which the iOS SDK forbids.
- **Sideload only.** The app is unsigned. With a free Apple ID it has to be re-signed every 7 days.

Everything else that's known is on the [issues page](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/issues).

## Short Instructions

1. Download `SilentHill-unsigned.ipa` from the latest [Build iOS Port](https://github.com/SlickAmogus/silent-hill-decomp/actions/workflows/build-ios.yml) run (iOS 13+).
2. Sideload it with **Sideloadly** or **AltStore**. On Windows, install iTunes and iCloud **from apple.com, not the Microsoft Store**; the Store versions break both tools. Leave auto-refresh running, since a free Apple ID certificate lasts only 7 days.
3. Launch the app once. Then use the **Files** app to put your disc image in `On My iPhone > Silent Hill > gamedata`. The top-level `Silent Hill` folder works too. Any filename works and no `.cue` is needed.

Saves, `config.cfg`, mods and the `SilentHill_<timestamp>.log` files are all in that same **Files** folder. The bundle ID (`com.silenthill.port`) never changes, so re-signing keeps your disc image and saves.

## Controls

| Touch | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Drag, left side | Move (push to the edge to run) |
| Drag, right side | Look |
| Tap | Action: attack with a weapon ready, interact otherwise |
| On-screen buttons | Aim (hold), Fire, Item, Map, Start, Change Camera, and the quick options overlay |

In the alternate cameras, dragging on the right turns the camera directly, a double tap on the left toggles aim, and a tap on the right fires. A physical controller uses the standard PSX layout.

## Building

### How the iOS build works

`ios_port/` holds only the app shell: a CMake project that builds SDL2 and `pc_port/` into an app bundle, plus `Info.plist`, a launch storyboard and a few small Objective-C files. The game itself is `pc_port/`. iOS-specific code stays behind `SH_IOS` / `TARGET_OS_IPHONE`, and much of it is shared with Android, so the port keeps up with PC development instead of turning into a fork.

- **Renderer:** PsyCross's GLES 3.0 path (`RENDERER_OGLES`), using Apple's `OpenGLES/ES3` headers and an EAGL context through SDL. On iOS, framebuffer 0 is not the screen, so PsyCross records SDL's real framebuffer (`PSYX_DEFAULT_FBO`) at init.
- **Audio:** OpenAL is compiled out (`SH_NO_OPENAL`). The SPU and XA audio are rendered in software and played through SDL's CoreAudio output.
- **Maps:** iOS won't load a dylib from outside the signed bundle, so `SH_STATIC_MAPS` is forced on. Each overlay's symbols get a per-map prefix via `llvm-objcopy --redefine-syms` so all 43 can be linked together, and a generated registry replaces `dlsym`.
- **Disabled:** ffmpeg, the libjpeg MJPEG decoder, Lua and the launcher (it's C#/.NET). RetroAchievements stays on: `ios_ra_http.m` implements it over NSURLSession, and `-Wl,-export_dynamic` keeps the game's globals visible for the achievement address map.
- **Startup:** SDL owns the entry point (`UIApplicationMain`). `main()` `chdir()`s into `Documents`, and `ios_bootstrap.m` copies the port's own assets out of the read-only bundle without overwriting existing files: fonts, `decal.png`, language packs, UI sounds and a default `config.cfg`. `UIFileSharingEnabled` and `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` make `Documents` visible in Files.

### Prerequisites

- **macOS with Xcode.** Xcode is used only as a toolchain; there is no Xcode project. Only Apple's clang can target `arm64-apple-ios`, so this can't be built on Windows or Linux.
- **cmake**, **ninja** and **llvm** (for `llvm-nm` / `llvm-objcopy`), e.g. from Homebrew.
- The SDL2, PsyCross and rcheevos submodules:
  ```
  git submodule update --init --recursive ios_port/SDL pc_port/PsyCross pc_port/third_party/rcheevos
  ```

### Build

```sh
./ios_port/build_ios.sh
```

This configures, builds and packages an unsigned `.ipa`. You don't need a Mac for this: [`.github/workflows/build-ios.yml`](.github/workflows/build-ios.yml) runs the same build on a GitHub macOS runner for every push to `ios-port` and uploads the `.ipa` as an artifact. See [`ios_port/README.md`](ios_port/README.md) for more technical notes.

## Modding

Mods are **on by default** on iOS, because there is no launcher to turn them on. On first launch the game creates the mod folders and writes a quick-reference `gamedata/load/README.txt` in the app's Files folder. Restart the game after adding or removing files. **Options > Graphics > Load Mods** turns loose-file mods off.

- **Loose-file replacements:** `gamedata/load/<FOLDER>/<NAME>`, using the disc's own folder and file names (e.g. `gamedata/load/CHARA/HERO.TIM`). Case doesn't matter.
  - **Textures:** `.png` or `.dds` next to the name (`HERO.TIM.png` or `HERO.png`), or a replacement `.TIM`
  - **Models:** replacement `.TMD` / `.ILM` / `.IPD`, and `.glb` for inventory items
  - **Sounds:** `SND/<BANK>.VAB`, or a single sound as `SND/<BANK>.001.wav`
  - **Voices:** `XA/xa_0001.wav`, or `XA/msg_<KEY>.wav` for a text box
  - **Text:** `text_overrides.txt`, or `text_overrides/<name>.txt`
- **Texture packs:** DuckStation-format packs in `gamedata/texturemods/`, either as a folder or a `.zip`. Always on. Memory budgets for packs scale down to the device's RAM.
- **Not available:** FMV overrides (see Known Issues).

The mod *tools* (disc extraction, TIM ↔ PNG, character texture reference sheets, ILM ↔ OBJ model export) are in the PC launcher's Mod Manager. Build mods on a PC, then copy the resulting `gamedata/` files to the device with Files (or Finder file sharing).
