 * a corrupted next-pointer (high garbage like 0x2B00..., the tpage
 * byte from the next muzzle-flash field write bleeding into bytes
 * that should have been part of an addr field).

 * prim header DECLARE_P_ADDR is 12 bytes on LP64 but 8 on 32-bit, so P_LEN is
 * 3 longs there and 2 here. The old `defined(SH_PC_PORT)` branch therefore
 * applied the LP64 offsets 16/24/32 to a build whose real slots are 12/20/28 --
 * verified by compiling offsetof against the live headers: P_LEN=2,
 * sizeof(POLY_FT4)=44, x0=12 x1=20 x2=28, u0=16. So every screen coordinate
 * landed in u0/clut, u1/tpage and u2, while x0..x2 kept whatever bytes the
 * recycled packet buffer held from an earlier frame. Three of four corners of
 * every prim built through this macro were stale garbage (only x3, written
 * separately by gte_stsxy, was right) -- the blood pool, the muzzle flash and
 * the glass shards, which is exactly the "line stretching from the monster to
 * the screen edge, flickering each frame while shooting" artifact, and it also
 * scrambled the tpage those prims sample.
 *
 * POLY_FT3 / POLY_FT4 / POLY_G3 all place x0/x1/x2 at the same 8-byte stride
 * (probed: 12/20/28 on Xbox), so one struct-derived form serves every caller
 * and stays byte-identical on the other targets: LP64 resolves to 16/24/32 and
